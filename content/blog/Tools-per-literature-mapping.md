## Introduzione alla literature mapping

Stiamo assistendo all'ascesa di una nuova classe di strumenti innovativi per la mappatura delle revisioni della letteratura, costruiti sulla base di metadati e citazioni sempre più aperti ( #openData ) e, probabilmente, di nuove tecniche di apprendimento automatico #machineLearning.

Ho individuato una dozzina di strumenti di questo tipo, e qui elencheròalcuni degli strumenti più recenti e intelligenti attualmente in circolazione.
